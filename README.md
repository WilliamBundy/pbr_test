		1. Edit windows.mak to point to the correct directories for the FBX sdk. 
		2. Have Visual Studio 2017 installed. You can edit make.bat if you need to change the version or directory
		3. Run make.bat. All dependencies are included.

	You should just be able to run pbr_test.exe from the bin/ folder, if need be. It checks the current working directory 
	for the model0/... files, so it's likely to fail elsewhere, unless you specify paths on the command line.

	Some notes about the code:
		- The important OpenGL code is in main.c and shaders/frag3d.glsl. The important FBX code is in wb_fbx.cc. I probably missed a few simple things with the FBX code; it's my first time using the format and the sdk.
		- main.c is heavily commented, but render_util.c seemed largely self-explanatory, and doesn't contain any real structure, so I hope it's understandable.
		- stb_image.h is a image loading library by Sean Barrett (and contributors). I use it for PNG loading.
		- wb_gl_loader.h is my own OpenGL loader, based off the official headers. 
		- shaders.h is generated by a little program; read the files in shaders/ instead.
		- C might seem anachronistic, but I like its simplicity, and it often compiles much faster (at least with MSVC). Especically working heavily with OpenGL, I don't think you gain too much by switching to C++.
